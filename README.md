Framework used: <br>

Backbone.js for front-end:<br>
It's the first time I use backbone, althought I have used JQuery before.<br>
PS: I haven't make any adjustment for mobile device, so if you are viewing it on your phone, it doesn't comes out as the best.<br>
<br>
nodejs express framework for back-end:<br>
<br>
Some of the locations can not be found by using Geocoder methods from google map. I haven't tried other methods yet.
