# Onerent Project
 How to use: <br> 
	Click the title to see the detail of every entry. <br/>
	since I don't have picture of each house, I just use the same picture. <br/> 
	'save'  and 'favourite' can be used to mark the entries which user want them to be saved or marked as favourite. But I haven't implement their function due the time limit<br/> 
	
The search bar: <br>
Type in location and click 'go' to search, the location is stripped from the database.<br>
you can type locations like { "Pacifica"   "Artesia"   "Pacoima"   "Corralitos" "Rose Garden"  "Capitola CA" "Madrone"  "RIO VISTA"  "Castroville" "Other Area" "Coastal"  "Palmdale"  "irvington"   "Barron Park"  "Shearwater"  "Chowchilla"  "Salinas"  "location" : "Los Prados" "location" : "modesto"  "location" : "Montara" }
